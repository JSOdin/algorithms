Doubly linked list
    -each element is an object with an attribute KEY and NEXT and PREV
    -data that are referred to by pointers is called SATELLITE DATA.
    -if x is an element,  x.prev points to the predecessor and x.next points to the next element. if x.prev is null, then x is the head. if x.next is null, x is the tail.
    -a "key" is the value of an element.
    -L.head is the first element of the list L. if L.head = null, L is empty.

Several forms of a list
    1) singly linked
    2) doubly linked
    3) sorted/unsorted
    4) circular/non circular

Singly linked
    - omit the .prev pointer in each element

sorted
    -linear order of the list corresponds to the linear order of the keys stored in the elements of the list.
    -minimum key element is the head, and max key element is the tail.

unsorted
    -head and tail can be any element and list appears in any order

circular
    -prev pointer of the head points to the tail and next of the tail points to head.
