What is an algorithm?
    -algorithm is a sequence of computational steps that transform the
     input into the output.

An instance of the problem
    -is the input of the problem

A correct algorithm
    -is considered so if it HALTS with the correct output.

NP-complete problems
    -problems for which there is no known efficient algorithm
    -if an efficient solution exists for one, then one exists for all of them
